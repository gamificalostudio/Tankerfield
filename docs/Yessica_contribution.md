 - **Improvemnt of the module map**: Added quadtree to the render. 
- **Implemented the controllers system:** Vibration, connect, detect controllers input.
- **General logic of enemies:** Movent, teleport, Burn state
		They got diferents state so it was easer to understand the code, and also to detect bugs and also to add more states.
- **Load colliders in tile system**
- **Pool of objects**  We got so many enemies that we needed this to not do so many *news*.
- **Reconfigurable keys** In the controllers option you can change de button you use in game, like the shoot button, and the helpers in game change. This information is saved when you close the game so it's ready to play again.

## Role
I present myself, my name is Aurelio Gamarra Alejandro Niño and I am responsible for the UI of our game Tankerfield and with my colleagues have made the development of this project possible. As the person in charge of the User Interface section, my main tasks have been:

* The supervision of the design of the UI.
* Design of the flow of menus, HUD and the different elements at the individual level.
* Organize and have control over the documents related to the UI.
* Intregration of the UI in the game code.
* Generate art

During the development of the game the UI has been evolving iteration after iteration always looking to be as intuitive and simple as possible to be able to adapt to the pillars of our game.

## Role
I present myself, my name is Alejandro Aurelio Gamarra Niño and I am responsible of the UI of our game Tankerfield and with my colleagues have made the development of this project possible. As the person in charge of the User Interface section, my main tasks have been:

* The supervision of the design of the UI.
* Design of the flow of menus, HUD and the different elements at the individual level.
* Organize and have control over the documents related to the UI.
* Intregration of the UI in the game code.
* Generate art

During the development of the game the UI has been evolving iteration after iteration always looking to be as intuitive and simple as possible to be able to adapt to the pillars of our game.

# Game Implementations

## Module UI / UI Manager
I implemented the UI module that serves as a factory and manager for all instances of UI elements.  This allows the creation of different types of elements, including:
* Images 
* Buttons
* Labels
* Bars
* Input Text
* Text Panels
* Tables 
* Sliders 

Other functions of the UI manager:
* Update Normal & In-Game Elements
* Add FXS (FadeOn, FadeOut, IntermitentFX)
* Color Modifications (like arrows)
* Draw Sort by hierarchy
* Pivots

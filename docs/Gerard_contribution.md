As a programmer, I had to design and write the Technical Design Document. This document precisely explains all the topics about the technology used and code information in general. The TDD is divided by:

**1.** Introduction

**2.** Unified Modelling Language

**3.** Code style

**4.** Target hardware

**5.** Performance budget

**6.** Branching policy

**7.** Version list

**8.** External libraries

**9.** Build delivery method

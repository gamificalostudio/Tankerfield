# Gerard Marcos Freixas. Role: Programmer

## Wiki contribution

As a programmer, I had to design and write the Technical Design Document. This document precisely explains all the topics about the technology used and code information in general. The TDD is divided by:

**1.** Introduction

**2.** Unified Modelling Language

**3.** Code style

**4.** Target hardware

**5.** Performance budget

**6.** Branching policy

**7.** Version list

**8.** External libraries

**9.** Build delivery method

Furthermore, I also took part in doing the Quality Assurance Plan Document, specifically:

**Â·** QA Introduction

**.** QA Bug properties

**.** QA Process for QC

## Game prototype

I also took part in the development of our videogame prototype. We used the Unity Game Engine to create this our prototype. I chelped with the tank shooting mechanics and its particle.

## Game implementation

In the first place, our project needed a base code structure to start developing our video game. We used my code, which had the basic functionalities of the engine, the modules (e.g. render module, window module, pathfinding module, scene module, and so on). From there, we have been implementing all the game features. Obviously, all the code that has been written followed the rules of the TDD.

The idea behind this formulas has been the following:
We need to balance for each round, so the rounds is the main variable for the progression.

PART 1: Go find weapons

- We need that weapons quicky become outdated, so you have to get new ones
	- And enemies also increase their health accordingly.

That's why the way we approached is that every round, enemies will have
	health = damage of the previous round * hits each round
Meaning that if hits each round is 2, enemies will have double health each time

This formula can be simplified to not take into account the damage of the previous round by making this:
	health = base damage * hits each round ^ round

With this idea we calculated the tesla trooper life
And an average of what each weapon should deal (the same as the tesla trooper life)

And we adjusted from that



PART 2: Incresing difficulty

- So the weapon damage and enemy health will make you go and get more weapons
- How does the game become more difficult every round?

- The difficulty will come from the number of enemies that each round will spawn
- It will get bigger each round, not matter what.
- And there will be no way to counter it, unlike in the previous case were you'd just get a better weapon.

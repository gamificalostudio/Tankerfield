![Options Menu](https://github.com/gamificalostudio/Tankerfield/blob/master/docs/V%C3%ADctor_Contributions_docs/Options%20Menu.jpg?raw=true)
For the Options Menu, I added the options you see in the image.

The Fullscreen change a bool in the Window Module that active or desactive the fullscreen mode.

Master Volume changes a float with base of 1 that is multiplied with the music volume and with every sfx volume.

The Music Volume and SFX volume are ints that modify the volume, after multiplying themselves with the master volume.

## Video Player
